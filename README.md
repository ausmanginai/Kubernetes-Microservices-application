# Deploying Microservices Application in Kubernetes

In this project a microservices application is built. A deployment and service for each microservice was created in the file config.yaml. Using the diagram provided by the development team, the deployment name, service name, ports and environmental variables etc. were determined for each microservice. Eventually the microservices application was deployed on a K8s cluster that was created using Linode.

To further advance the code, helm charts and helmfiles were used to deploy the application. This made the deployment process more elegant and efficient.
